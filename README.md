 A largely unquestioned and bias grading and to improve reading outcomes. this capstone project aim to develop a desktop based application to help teachers for measuring and describing the child’s reading comprehension level through the use of sound pattern and audio recognition.


The Philippine Informal Reading Inventory (Phil-IRI) is an initiative of the Bureau of the Department of Education that directly addresses its trust to make every Filipino child a reader. It is anchored on the flagship program of the DepEd “Every Child A Reader Program” (ECARP). A speed and comprehension assessment tool that evaluates the reading proficiency level of elementary school pupils that intends to enable every Filipino child to communicate both English and Filipino through effective reading instruction. 

Phil-IRI attempt to measure the pupil’s readability level in Phil-IRI Oral Test, Phil-IRI Silent Reading Comprehension and Phil-IRI Listening Comprehension Levels. These three types of assessment aim to find the student’s independent, instructional and frustration levels. Currently, it was done manually by the elementary teachers. It is one of the diagnostic tools that teachers can use to determine student’s abilities and needs in reading.

This application aim to provide an easy way for teachers to calculate their student’s reading abilities through the use of voice and speech recognition. The researcher’s system, shows the reading rate per minute, the number of miscues, the speed in oral reading and the student’s comprehension level. It helps the teacher’s to automatically calculate their reading skills, by using a sound pattern and audio recognition in determining their readability skills.
